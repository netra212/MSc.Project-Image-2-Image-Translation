#. Perceptron ?
-> Kinds of Algorithm.
-> Mathematical model or mathematical function. 
-> 

Two steps of the machine learing:
1. Training.
2. Prediction. 


Example:-
Let's suppose, we have an student's datasets of 100 Points. 
CGPA | IQ  | Placed
78   | 7.8 | 1
69   | 5.1 | 0

Q. What if, there is more than two input columns ? what is the design of the perceptron at that time ?
ans: 

# Deep Learning is heavily inspired by the human nervous systems ?
# weights: tells the feature importance.
