Example:- 
Let's suppose, I have an datasets:- 
Simple, binary classification.
Goal: To build the simple function or relationships between between features. 

age     have_insurance
23          0
25          0
47          1
52          0
46          1
56          1
55          0


# sigmoid_function(z) = 1/(1+e^-z) where e = Euler's number ~ 2.71828
Let's suppose z = 200 then 1/(1+2.71828^-200) ~ output will be almost close to 1. 
Basically, Sigmoid function converts the input into the range of 0 to 1. 

# Catch here is: 
value < 0.5, Person will not buy the insurance.
value > 0.5, Person will buy the insurance.

step 1:
y = m*x + b 
In Regression, we always tries to find the value of the m and b. 
Let's suppose, x = Age. 
Now, above equation is y = m*Age + b. 

Neuron is nothing but it is the combination of the Linear function and the activation function. 
suppose here:
output = (m*Age + b) + 1/(1+e^-z) --> 0.57
where, Age: Input feature. 
Above equation can be written as:
y or output = (w1 * x1) + (w2 * x2) + (w3 * x3) + b 
where, 
x1 = Age,
x2 = Income, 
x3 = Education,
and b = bias 
And w1, w2 and w3. 

Now, the above equation can be written as in generic way:

y = Sum Of (w_i * x_i + b) from i = 0 to i = n.

step 2:
z = 1/(1+e^-z)
