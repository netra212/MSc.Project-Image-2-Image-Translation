Types of ML Learning:
********************************
1. Supervised:
********************************
-> Input and output or labels. 
Contains:
Regression: Label --> Numerical.
Classification: Label --> Categorical. 

********************************
2. Unsupervised:
********************************
-> Input without Labels. 
Clustering. 
Association. 
Dimensionality Reduction. 
Anomoly detection. 

********************************
3. Reinforcement:

#. K means Clustering:
********************************
********************************
Problem statement:
1. Decide k clusters. 
2. Initialize Centroids. 
3. Start Iterations. 
Assign clusters. 
Move centroid. 
Check and stop. 

#. How do we decide correct value of k ?
--> Elbow method --> works on the principle of the inertia. 

# Limitation of Elbow Methods:
1. Subjectivity in Identifying the Elbow. 
2. Not suitable for all Datasets.
3. Performance with large number of features. 
4. Does not consider cluster quality. 
5. Sensitivity of scaling. 

# Assumptions of K-Means:
1. Spherical Cluster shape. 
2. Similar Cluster shape. 
3. Equal Variance of cluster. 
4. Clusters are well separated. 
5. Number of Clusters(k) is pre-defined. 
6. Large n, Small K. 


# Limitation of K-Means:
1. Vulnerability to Outliers. 
2. Hard Clustering. 
3. High-Dimensional Challenge. 
4. Sensitive to scale. 

Note: Euclidean distance is not reliable at high dimensional data-points.
